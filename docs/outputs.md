# ðŸ“¦ Explaining the outputs

## BAM and VCF files

Each sample will have an output of:

- the alignment (BAM) between its sequencing reads and the mitochondrion genome
- the variants (VCF) found by using the Mutect2 program.

## The CSV file

This output has many data that can be useful in different ways.

> I've copy-paste some outputs definitions from [Picard documentation](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html) and from [Haplockeck](https://mitoverse.readthedocs.io/haplocheck/haplocheck/#minor-heteroplasmy-level) here for convenience.

### From CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics process

==CATEGORY==: Just being explicity that te reads metrics are only considering paired-end alignments

==TOTAL_READS==: Total of reads in the alignment

==PF_READS==: The total number of reads passing filter (PF), where the filter(s) can be platform/vendor quality controls

==PCT_PF_READS==: The fraction of reads passing filter, PF_READS/TOTAL_READS

==PF_NOISE_READS==: The number of PF reads that are marked as noise reads. A noise read is one which is composed entirely of A bases and/or N bases. These reads are marked as they are usually artifactual and are of no use in downstream analysis.

==PF_HQ_ALIGNED_READS==: The number of PF reads that were aligned to the reference sequence with a mapping quality of Q20 or higher signifying that the aligner estimates a 1/100 (or smaller) chance that the alignment is wrong.

==PF_HQ_ALIGNED_BASES==: The number of bases aligned to the reference sequence in reads that were mapped at high quality. Will usually approximate PF_HQ_ALIGNED_READS * READ_LENGTH but may differ when either mixed read lengths are present or many reads are aligned with gaps.

==PF_HQ_ALIGNED_Q20_BASES==: The subset of PF_HQ_ALIGNED_BASES where the base call quality was Q20 or higher.

==PF_HQ_MEDIAN_MISMATCHES==: The median number of mismatches versus the reference sequence in reads that were aligned to the reference at high quality (i.e. PF_HQ_ALIGNED READS).

==PF_HQ_ERROR_RATE==: The fraction of bases that mismatch the reference in PF HQ aligned reads.

==PF_INDEL_RATE==: The number of insertion and deletion events per 100 aligned bases. Uses the number of events as the numerator, not the number of inserted or deleted bases.

==MEAN_READ_LENGTH==: The mean read length of the set of reads examined. When looking at the data for a single lane with equal length reads this number is just the read length. When looking at data for merged lanes with differing read lengths this is the mean read length of all reads.

==STRAND_BALANCE==: The number of PF reads aligned to the positive strand of the genome divided by the number of PF reads aligned to the genome.

==PCT_SOFTCLIP==: the fraction of PF bases that are on (primary) aligned reads and are soft-clipped, as a fraction of the PF_ALIGNED_BASES (even though these are not aligned!)
